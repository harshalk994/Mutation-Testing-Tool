* MuTester

  - MuTester is a Mutation Testing Tool aimed for the academic demonstration of the mutation testing technique. 

  - It is developed to support the teaching of the mutation testing technique at colleges and universities. 

* What is Mutation Testing?

  - Software testers write test cases to test the quality of the software. 
  - However, it is equally important to test the quality of your test suite and ensure that it is robust enough to detect as many faults in the system as possible.
  - Mutation Testing is the metric used to assess the quality of your test suites. 

* Current Functionality
  - MuTester currently supports assessing the efficiency of your JUnit test suites by generating a mutation score and mutation report. These metrics will give you a clear understanding on the robustness of your test suite and help you improve its efficiency.
